					<p class="MsoNormal">Mel M. Heravi, PhD</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<img alt="" src="../img/Mel_Heravi.jpg" width="57" height="75" /></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Are we on the right track with Current 
					Internet Application Development Tools?</p>
					<ul type="disc">
						<li class="MsoNormal">You will learn a non-traditional 
						way of creating sophisticated Internet applications in 
						days, rather than months and years with far fewer 
						resources.</li>
						<li class="MsoNormal">Are internet application that much 
						different than traditional environments? The answer NO, 
						you will see for yourself in a live demo.</li>
						<li class="MsoNormal">Why did we move away from assembly 
						languages ? complicated, low level and kind of 
						unmanageable right? Then why are we stuck with HTML 
						coding? If you liken HTML to the assembly language of 
						internet, you will be learning about a new approach that 
						is by comparison 4GL.</li>
						<li class="MsoNormal">Can you build an online 
						application in ½ hour or less? You will see for yourself 
						that the answer is YES, Its all about the tools you use 
						and how you use it.</li>
						<li class="MsoNormal">Toolkits are supposed to be 
						enablers to the developers. You have by now learned that 
						to do the simplest thing on the internet requires a 
						great amount of effort and manpower. It does not have to 
						be. Its all about the tools and the direction you are 
						heading. With the crowed in which case you are following 
						all the time or ahead of the crowed and take control of 
						your time and money.</li>
						<li class="MsoNormal">You will learn why most successful 
						companies, like Google, AOL, Yahoo never followed the 
						main path and developed their own approach.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="MsoNormal">There will be short demo on &#8220;the making 
					of a web application in ½ hour&#8221; Demo requires a projector so 
					that audience can see for themselves how its done as well as 
					question &amp; answer session for about 10-15 minutes.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Biography:</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Heravi received his education in 
					Manchester,England. A B.Sc in Mechanical Engineering, 
					followed by M.Sc in Computational Fluid Dynamics and a Ph.D 
					in Aerospace. His doctoral thesis was on a reverse design of 
					highly subsonic aircraft engine intake, the result of which 
					is apparent in all new highspeed aircrafts.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The nature of his studies lead him to 
					NASA Ames at Moffett Field in California where he was a 
					senior real-time man-in-the-loop simulation engineer 
					(world's largest simulation facility). He participated in 
					such highly visibility projects as, Space Shuttle, Osprey, 
					X-Wing and other futuristic aircrafts.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Later Dr. Heravi moved to Boeing 
					Defense in PA, to pursue his long time dream of designing a 
					graphic language for Control System Engineers. His dream 
					became a reality when he designed and developed CLIP 
					(Control Law Interface Program) where engineers could draw 
					block diagram on a computer screen and go to simulation and 
					see their results (matlab did the same a decade later). HeI 
					also taught courses in Computer Science and Engineering at 
					San Francisco State University and the University of San 
					Francisco.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Heravi was there at the start of 
					X-Windowing system and worked as a consultant to most major 
					financial institutions in the US. Provided training in 
					X/Motif and developing applications.</p>
