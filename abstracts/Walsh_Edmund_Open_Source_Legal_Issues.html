					<p class="MsoNormal">Open Source Legal Issues</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Open source licensing is now a 
					consideration for every software developer and for every 
					software &quot;buyer.&quot; But it is far from simple and monolithic. 
					While some have built businesses around open source 
					licensing, open source is incompatible with some business 
					models. The benefits, as well as the limitations and risks, 
					of open source licensing will be covered. Recent changes in 
					the GPL, a widely used open source license, as well as 
					possible trends towards litigation in the open source 
					community will be covered. This presentation is targeted to 
					engineers and executives who must understand the business 
					implications and pitfalls of using open source.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Biography:</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Ed Walsh is a shareholder and member of 
					the Electrical &amp; Computer Technologies Group at Wolf 
					Greenfield, the largest law firm in New England devoted 
					exclusively to intellectual property law. Electrical and 
					computer-related clients benefit from Ed&#8217;s experience in IP 
					strategy development and execution, including patent 
					prosecution, clearances and counseling, IP portfolio 
					management, litigation, licensing, consulting agreements, 
					and joint development agreements. His areas of technical 
					expertise include semiconductor processing and high-speed 
					circuit design, software, networks and network management, 
					connectors and interconnection technology, and many types of 
					test equipment. Before coming to the firm, Ed had over 14 
					years experience serving as in-house counsel for technology 
					companies, the most recent of which was as Chief 
					Intellectual Property Counsel for Teradyne, Inc., a position 
					he held for 10 years. Previous positions held by Ed include 
					that of Division IP Counsel for Textron Specialty Materials 
					and Patent Attorney for Raytheon. Prior to entering law 
					school, he worked as an electrical engineer, developing 
					operating system software and analyzing communications 
					systems. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Ed received his undergraduate degree in 
					Electrical Engineering from Boston University, a masters 
					degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, 
					and his law degree from Suffolk University Law School. He 
					served as both an Adjunct Professor and Lecturer in 
					electrical engineering at Boston University, where he taught 
					classes in circuit theory and dynamic systems theory. He was 
					a Fellow of the National Science Foundation and has also 
					been a faculty member for both the Massachusetts Continuing 
					Legal Education IP Program and Suffolk University Law 
					School&#8217;s Advanced Legal Studies Program. Ed taught a Suffolk 
					Advanced Legal Studies course entitled Maximizing Business 
					Value From IP, was a guest lecturer at Boston University 
					School of Management for a class on IP strategy, and has 
					presented and written extensively on open source software.</p>
