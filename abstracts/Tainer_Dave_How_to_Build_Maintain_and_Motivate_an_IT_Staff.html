					<p class="MsoNormal">How to Build, Maintain, and Motivate an 
					IT Staff</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">An excellent IT staff starts with a 
					good second-in-command, the person you trust as much as 
					yourself. This person could be an IT Generalist or have one 
					specific skill, but it has to be someone that can replace 
					you, at least temporarily. Once this person is in place, you 
					can begin to see what roles are required in your 
					organization, for instance, where to hire experience (and 
					pay more), and where to hire young (and pay less). We&#8217;ll 
					look at basic flow chart options for different size 
					organizations and needs and also how best to retain the high 
					performers. Interview tips for all levels of IT staff, and 
					how to tailor motivation to the individual are key elements 
					of the presentation.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Biography:</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Dave Tainer is Director of Information 
					Systems for GMHC, a Manhattan-based nonprofit that was first 
					in the fight against AIDS. Dave is responsible for providing 
					IT guidance and vision to operations and programs since 
					coming on board in January 2006. He has successfully 
					implemented structured corporate principles of IT management 
					(CoBIT, MOF), which have resulted in increased productivity, 
					faster network access, enhanced security, compliance with 
					HIPAA, and a data migration to a governmental database and 
					reporting system. He was instrumental in securing a 
					$1,106,000 technology-only capital grant from NYEDC which 
					has allowed for a state-of-the-art network infrastructure, 
					new workstations for all staff, and a VoIP implementation.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Prior to GMHC, Dave was adjunct faculty 
					at DePaul University in Chicago since 2000, teaching in 
					three departments: Human-Computer Interaction as a Usability 
					specialist, Computer Science as a database and systems 
					specialist, and Digital Cinema as a technical specialist 
					(digital cinematography). He previously taught business 
					statistics at other Chicago-area universities, mostly for 
					MBA programs.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Between 1998 and 2005 Dave served as 
					founder and senior partner of BuTain, Inc., a technology 
					consulting firm specializing in IT Strategy and Management 
					Consulting. He previously held the position of CIO for 
					Unified Management, a professional employer organization 
					(PEO). During his tenure at Unified, Dave was a frequent 
					guest speaker on all IT issues in the PEO industry at 
					events, conferences and roundtables, and helped Unified 
					Management define the cutting-edge in PEO technology and 
					information management. Dave honed his expertise during an 
					applied academic career in Sociology and Statistics, which 
					led him into studying social behavior, applying it to 
					marketing and advertising, and finally helping build the 
					technology that he manages today. He is married to Mary S. 
					Butler, an accomplished Online Media Strategist and most 
					recently the Editor of ForbesAutos.com in New York and 
					currently with Avenue A | Razorfish. He very much enjoyed 
					his summer teaching inner-city kids html programming and Web 
					site basics for the Gallery 37 project in Chicago several 
					years ago. Dave is an independent filmmaker of near-zero 
					renown who also works on soundtracks for other filmmakers.</p>
