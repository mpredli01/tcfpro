            <h5 class="card-title">UX of Politics and the Politics of UX: New Jersey’s County Line Ballot Design Lawsuit</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Becky will walk you through the recent (and still developing!) history of primary ballot design in New Jersey, centering on Andy Kim’s 2024 lawsuit to eliminate the "county line" grid based layout.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Drawing on work from the Center for Civic Design, we will examine how politics shape the user experience, how the user experience for voters can shape political outcomes in turn, and how we as UX professionals and civic-minded citizens can get involved.
