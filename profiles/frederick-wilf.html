            <h5 class="card-title">Infinite Monkey Selfies: Intellectual Property Protection for Generative Artificial Intelligence Creations</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Infinite-Monkey-Theorem#:~:text=The%20Infinite%20Monkey%20Theorem%20is,the%20complete%20works%20of%20Shakespeare." target="_blank">Infinite Monkey Theorem</a> states that an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of keyboards would eventually generate the complete works of William Shakespeare.
                A more recent, and far more limited test of this theorem involved a professional photographer named <a href="http://www.djsphotography.co.uk/" target="_blank">David Slater</a> providing several great apes with access to his cameras.
                The photographer sold copies of the resulting monkey selfies, which in turn generated a great deal of discussion and a few court cases over the question of who owned the copyrights in the selfies.
            <p class="card-text">
                In the past year, the issue has shifted from monkey-created works to generative AI works.
                Who owns the rights to works and inventions created in whole or in part by a computer program?
                Who will speak for the monkeys?
                And will chatbots speak for themselves?

            <h5 class="card-title">Privacy Law Update 2022</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Privacy law continues to evolve as recently-passed legislation in California has led to new regulations and the creation of a privacy-specific agency in California, i.e., the <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/" target="_blank">California Privacy Protection Agency</a>.
                Other states are following Californiaâ€™s lead by passing new laws and regulations, all while Congress considers whether or not it wants legislate in this field.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                The focus of this talk is recent changes in privacy law and what they mean to IT people working in the field and to the general public.
