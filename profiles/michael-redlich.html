            <h5 class="card-title">Jakarta EE 11: Going Beyond the Era of Java EE</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Since its introduction in 2018 as <a href="https://jakarta.ee/" target="_blank">Jakarta EE</a>, the platform has evolved from: Jakarta EE 8, an open-source version of Java EE 8; to Jakarta EE 9, the "big bang" release; to Jakarta EE 10 that introduced the <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/coreprofile/" target="_blank">Core Profile</a>.
                Jakarta EE 11, scheduled for a GA release in 1Q2024, will introduce new specifications, provide updated specifications, and set the baseline to Java 21, the latest LTS release.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                This presentation will provide a brief history of JavaEE/Jakarta EE and a review of new and updated specifications with code examples.
            </p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Getting Started with Jakarta NoSQL and MongoDB (ITPC 2023, ITPC 2022)</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/nosql/" target="_blank">Jakarta NoSQL</a> specification defines a set of APIs to provide a standard implementation for most NoSQL databases.
                Considered "one API for many NoSQL databases," Jakarta NoSQL supports the four types of NoSQL databases: column family, document, graph and key-value.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                This presentation will provide an introduction to the Jakarta NoSQL specification, <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jnosql" target="_blank">Eclipse JNoSQL</a>, the compatible implementation to the specification, a brief overview of all four NoSQL database types followed by a demonstration of a MongoDB application built with Jakarta NoSQL.
