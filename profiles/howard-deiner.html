            <h5 class="card-title">What Did Life Under COVID-19 Teach Us About DevOps?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The world changed more as a result of COVID-19 than it did as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US in terms of the number of deaths and suffering of innocent people.
                Yet we took immediate action after the September 11 attacks and have kept up that vigilance for more than two decades.
                But after COVID-19, we are quickly trying to forget the misery and move on.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                One radial change for many in the time of COVID-19 was mandatory shelter-in-place orders.
                People were forced to work remotely from their homes.
                We’ve known for decades the benefits of collocation for effectiveness in getting software development work done well.
                But that was no longer possible.
                Furthermore, as we move past the crisis, some people have learned a true life lesson.
                Life is tenuous, and the idea of the daily grind into the office and lack of work-life balance have made a surprising number of people say, “I quit” to their bosses.
                They yearn for better pay and better work-life balance, especially when they have substantial and marketable skills.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                I was hopeful at the beginning of the crisis that we could take the time and make the effort to improve our collective workplaces. But I claim that we didn’t.
                In fact, we may have made them worse than ever.
                This talk will explore what we did wrong, and how we could have done better.
                But just because we missed the ball the first time around doesn’t mean that it’s too late to improve for the future.
                Let’s discuss how.
