            <p class="card-text">
                This talk will explore a website design story. A nonprofit group, Living Beyond Breast Cancer (LBBC) [a locally-headquartered, national nonprofit offering trusted information and community support], redesigned its complex website to better serve users while maintaining crucial SEO (Search Engine Optimization) traffic.
                This case study will explain how strategic brand and UX considerations can motivate a unique approach to menus and user flow.
                The redesign was able to boost KPIs without sacrificing brand messaging.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                The talk will also briefly explore the technical side of a seamless SEO transition.
                It is especially useful for anyone tasked with reshaping a content-heavy site, and you will walk away with practical takeaways and ideas to implement in your own work.
