            <p class="card-text">
                As technology becomes more innovative, companies want to save money, and managers want to maximize output and value of their teams, what is the impact of automation and anticipatory design?
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                As designers and technologies, what is the ethical line of making decisions on behalf of the people who use our products?
                As a society, what happens if more of our roles are automated?
                And what is the impact of AI on trust that users and consumers have for products and brands?
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                This talk explores four cautions and four design principles to consider as automation inserts itself into the products we create and use.
