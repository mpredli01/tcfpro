            <h5 class="card-title">Teaching User-Centered Design to People Who Aren't Interested</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                At Fairleigh Dickinson University, Susan has been teaching a human-computer interaction class to IT and cybersecurity undergraduates, for whom the class is just a peculiar required course.
                She also taught "Websites 101," which was advertised as a way to set up a free website, to small business owners on Staten Island.
                However, in both cases, the participants got more than they bargained for.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                The college students learn about affordances, signifiers, conceptual models, and gulfs of evaluation and execution &dash; in other words, why simple things in their environments don’t work the way they're supposed to.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                The small business owners learned how physiology trumps aesthetics and how Jacob Nielsen's "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" play out in real life.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                In this session, you’ll learn how to explain user-centered design issues to co-workers and supervisors who are unfamiliar with or uninterested in the topic &dash; until you show them what it means for their products and services.
