            <p class="card-text">
                Complexity isn’t just complicated, it’s actually complex.
                The old-school command-and-control style of leadership is no match for our volatile times, increasing uncertainty, increasing complexity, and high levels of ambiguity.
                Do you have the skills to lead through complexity?
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Learn how to use all the resources at your disposal to lead your project team through uncertainty and complexity to success, using proven methods.
                You will learn how to make the most of differences of opinion, making them work to drive discussions towards resolution in a supportive, nonjudgmental fashion.
                Learn how much time successful teams spend on developing a shared understanding.
                Learn about the many valuable strategies and resources on leading through complexity that are available to leaders in 2025 and beyond.
                Understand the mess that generative AI is creating, and how the future provides opportunities for UX professionals to be uniquely qualified to lead the clean-up.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Bring your burning questions, examples of thorny, wicked problems that you currently are facing, and seemingly intractable situations for a lively discussion.

            <h5 class="card-title">Non-Generative AI and UX: My Personal Field Notes (ITPC 2024)</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Josephine will share her personal experiences with several non-generative AI implementations:
                <ol>
                    <li>How she proposed a framework and metric for evaluating the performance of AI in predicting project profits.</li>
                    <li>How she helped AT&amp;T improve several key metrics by using UX design and research to implement an expert system.</li>
                    <li>How she used her UX-related skills to support the implementation of Robotic Process Automation projects.</li>
                    <li>How her ethnographic research laid the groundwork for future AI data modeling.</li>
                    <li>How she used her background in machine learning and UX to provide user-centered documentation of an exciting, new healthcare IT product.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Josephine will distinguish between generative and non-generative AI, and encourage participants to build their own AI implementation as a personal learning experience.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Key Takeaways:
                <ol>
                    <li>You don't have to have studied calculus to successfully provide user-centered design, research, and related services as part of an AI implementation.</li>
                    <li>AI has been around for decades, there are many ways to implement AI, many of them are non-generative.</li>
                    <li>You will learn the difference between generative and non-generative AI.</li>
                    <li>You can build your own no-code AI implementation, and you will learn a lot by doing so. Josephine encourages you to do it!</li>
