            <h5 class="card-title">Modernize your APIs with GraphQL</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Have you been on slow internet connections and been frustrated that some things partially work while you’re excruciatingly waiting on a data heavy API call to load?
                Data access performance is highly important and an overlooked aspect of web development.
                Data performance and reducing data round trips in relational data directly impact user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a> was created to make requesting nested and potentially-cyclical data simpler without the need to have specialized endpoints.
                GraphQL is more agnostic to how the “server” stores the information, it is a self-service approach where API developers can create a flexible, open-ended data access medium that end users can consume as they wish.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                This session will focus on a modern full-stack architecture that leverages GraphQL to facilitate client- server communications implemented with <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>.
