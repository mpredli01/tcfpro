            <h5>Building Real-Time Generative AI Pipelines</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                In this talk, Tim will delve into the exciting realm of building real-time generative AI pipelines with streaming capabilities.
                The discussion will revolve around the integration of cutting-edge technologies to create dynamic and responsive systems that harness the power of generative algorithms.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                From leveraging streaming data sources to implementing advanced machine learning models, the presentation will explore the key components necessary for constructing a robust real-time generative AI pipeline.
                Practical insights, use cases, and best practices will be shared, offering a comprehensive guide for developers and data scientists aspiring to design and implement dynamic AI systems in a streaming environment.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Tim will show a live demo showing we can use Apache NiFi to provide a live chat between a person in Slack and several LLM models all orchestrated with Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka and Python.
                We will use RAG against Chroma and Pinecone vector data stores, Hugging Face and WatsonX.AI LLM, and add additional context with NiFi lookups of stocks, weather and other data streams in real-time.
            </p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Building Modern Data Streaming Apps (ITPC 2023)</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                In this session, I will show you some best practices I have discovered over the last seven years in building data streaming applications including IoT, CDC, Logs, and more.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                In my modern approach, we utilize several Apache frameworks to maximize the best features of all.
                We often start with Apache NiFi as the orchestrator of streams flowing into Apache Pulsar.
                From there we build streaming ETL with Spark, enhance events with Pulsar Functions for ML and enrichment.
                We build continuous queries against our topics with Flink SQL.
