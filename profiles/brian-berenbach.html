            <h5 class="card-title">Brian Berenbach</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Brian has been teaching both undergraduate and graduate courses in computer science and systems engineering since 1980.
                He recently retired from lecturing at Georgia Tech, where he taught graduate courses in the systems engineering program.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Brian previously was a senior systems engineer at first ABB and then Siemens, where he designed systems for modeling the behavior of nuclear power plants and medical systems.
                While working at Siemens he received 5 patents, and he wrote a book on requirements engineering.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                He has graduate degrees in chemical physics and nuclear engineering, and has been given the ACM Distinguished Engineer Award, and the INCOSE Expert Systems Engineer certification.
                Brian is also an IEEE senior life member.

            <h5 class="card-title">Using SysML to Model a Hospital Blood Analyzer</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Many software engineers have some understanding of SysML, using it to make sketches of system software.
                In this talk, Brian will walk the audience from requirements, through design using SysML as the diagram repository.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                There will be illustrations of diagrams showing requirements, analysis and the design of a high capacity (thousands of samples per hour).
                Brian will also show a short video of the actual analyzer in operation.
