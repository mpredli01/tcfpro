            <h5 class="card-title">The Weird World of Financial Fraud & Cyberscams</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Financial fraud and cyberscams are not just fearful topics featured in late-night infomercials.
                In the first half of 2022, U.S. Consumers reported a record $3.56B lost to online fraud (a 50% increase from the same period in 2021), with nearly 800,000 such complaints provided to the Federal Trade Commission.
                Imposter scams represented the highest percentage of these reported cases, with more than 361,000 filings, totaling $1.33B in losses.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Cyberscams have become so pervasive that Amazon issued a warning message in December to all of its customers.
                This briefing session will examine various financial fraud methods, including check fraud (paperhanging, floating, kiting), and identity theft.
                Ways to protect yourself and your business will be suggested.
