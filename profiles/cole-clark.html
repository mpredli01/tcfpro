            <p class="card-text">
                As software developers, we typically use the tools we feel most comfortable with, but when it comes to backend APIs, there's a ton of languages, libraries, and tools to choose from.
                It's important to be able to identify the benefits of each language to determine what is best for our use case.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                In this talk, weâ€™ll compare the advantages and disadvantages to creating an API in three popular languages along with their runtime environments: GoLang, Python (using Flask) and JavaScript (using Node.js).
