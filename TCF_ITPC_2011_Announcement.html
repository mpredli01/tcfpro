<P style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px; margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px">Design Patterns - Dr. Dennis Mancl, Alcatel-Lucent</p>
<P style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px; margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px">Design Patterns are descriptions of design solutions that can be reused in many situations. Patterns have become a useful way to discuss software design problems, but they can also be applied to many other kinds of business problems.  This talk will give an overview of some of the most common design patterns, as well as some patterns that can be applied to software architecture, systems analysis, and project management.</P>
<P style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px; margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px">SQL Server 2008 R2 and Beyond - Joe Mozelesky, Omicron Consulting</P>
<P style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px; margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px">This session will provide an overview of new features in Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 and the SQL Server 2008 R2 Feature Pack, as well as a sneak peak at the many new features of the upcoming SQL Server “Denali” release. SQL Server and the ecosystem of tools around it have continued to grow and become both more sophisticated and more accessible. We will look at the new Report Builder 3.0, Reporting Services integration with SharePoint, PowerPivot – an in memory OLAP engine add-on for Excel, as well as the new integrated IDE for Denali hosted in the Visual Studio 2010 shell. We will also cover a few new performance optimizations including column-based query acceleration.</P>
